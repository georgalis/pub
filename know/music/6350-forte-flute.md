This curation is a fun set of flute etudes.
* Kossenko provides a wonderful interpretation of Eugene Walckiers (1793-1866).
* Locatelli Op3 L arte del Violino number 1 is tuned 10% slow and a voice lower for gesture study.
* There is an passage of Griffes A93 Poem 1918, presented in 1/4 time for comparison between Joseph Mariano 1942 performance, and Wincenc from 1985.
* All 24 Furstenau Op125 Etudes performed by Yoshizono have been aesthetically re-sequenced, time shifted for another interpretation of the original score, and nominally (cents) pitch adjusted to complement the re-timing.  ([Score of 24 Furstenau Op125 Etudes](https://s9.imslp.org/files/imglnks/usimg/d/d5/IMSLP707515-PMLP742348-F%C3%BCrstenau,_Anton_-_24_Uebungen,_Capricen_und_Pr%C3%A4ludien_op.125_(1839).pdf))
* Flute duets of Mozart K620 Die Zauberflote performed by Yoshizono have been liberally re-timed and re-pitched, for a new aesthetic. Translation of the original titles is a new interpretation.

Notably missing are Boem's etudes and others, they may be added in the future.
