# Music Curation Tooling

This is a complex workflow! If it is ever fully documented,
this is the beginning!

The workflow tools are mostly bash shell functions in
[fn.bash](https://github.com/georgalis/pub/blob/master/sub/fn.bash),
which depend on some environment setup found in
[.profile](https://github.com/georgalis/pub/blob/master/skel/.profile).

## Environment

these varables should be set and exported
links=
rubberband=
ytdl=/opt/homebrew/bin/yt-dlp

## Software
ffmpeg

## Export
For export to a sd card, the path is hard coded /volumes/CURATE/kind
