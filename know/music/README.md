### Music Curation

Welcome!

In 2020 much effort was taken to organize a playlist of the most important music
([5fb3-deja-muse](https://github.com/georgalis/pub/blob/master/know/music/5fb3-deja-muse.md#a-2020-musical-playlist-5fb3-deja-muse)),
timeless music, for all times. Following that, subsequent volumes would represent compositions and
performances, supplementing the former. How many works, from what generas? How many volumes? These
are tough questions, the answer is an amalgamation of careful study, practice, discovery, tools
development, time effort balance, and some of the vitality that inspires all things.

A very significant effort has been taken to normalize the volume levels for a non-intrusive
listening aesthetic. The _EBU_R128_ loudness normalization standard is incorporated in volume 2 and
will be applied in the second release of the first volume. Additionally, appropriate compression
profiles are applied to adapt a wide variety of source material (from old old vinyl to studio
digital) and instrumentation (from solo baroque flute, to harpsichord, piano and orchestra) for an
improved contiguous listening aesthetic.

Some selections have an altered tempo and/or pitch---for each alteration, there is an
explanation. Generally, the intent is to remove avant-garde qualities, while accentuating timeless
aspects; not to change the art, but minimizing the sensational to accentuate timeless genius.

These changes are intended help the works fit in the broader timeframe of today, verses the
presentation that conforms to respective stylistic expectations of their age. Today more
information is perceived as better, even though information overload is a concept we are all too
familiar with. It is somewhat natural that modern attention will easily miss subtleties that make
these selections timeless. Locatelli violin concertos are an extraordinary presentation of gesture
and melody, careful study is required to appreciate them.  Yet, their presentation is an apex of
performance, not an introduction for modern ears. They are presented 10% slower and a full voice
lower, so the subtleties and the high art of the original form can be heard. Ironically, in this
case, less is more.

Certain tonal intermodulation is accentuated when performed with a baroque temperament (or rather,
doesn't exist without it).  Some compositions have a piercing element to accentuate an elegant
novelty, which otherwise may have gone unnoticed, when originally presented. Some jazz standards
have been been performed so slowly that it is difficult to recognize the melody. Today, All of
these adjustments, as presented here, are intended to ring true the authenticity of the original,
attenuating charisma of their age and accentuating the elements that make them timeless.

This is the optimal study sequence of the volumes (not their sorted sequence). Revisions to the
various volumes are made, from time to time.

1. [5fb3-deja-muse](https://github.com/georgalis/pub/blob/master/know/music/5fb3-deja-muse.md), volume 1, from Sun, 28 Feb 2021, is the only formally released volume, distinguished by notes linked here, vs only a file listing for the others. Some technical revisions are underway.
1. [63d2-requeues](https://github.com/georgalis/pub/blob/master/know/music/63d2-requeues.list), the second volume, is a logical extension of the first. It is on track for final release, but many additions, pruning, and balance changes are still planned.
1. [5deb-melody-royal](https://github.com/georgalis/pub/blob/master/know/music/5deb-melody-royal.list), the third volume, is it is a condensed presentation of the fourth volume. Unlikely there will be much content change, probably some technical revisions.
1. [5d50-kindle-class](https://github.com/georgalis/pub/blob/master/know/music/5d50-kindle-class.list), the fourth volume, is and marks the beginning of the effort to identify collections suitable for non-intrusive, continuous listening (aka timeless selections); for playback on a kindle reader and the foundation of the curation development workflow [tool](https://github.com/georgalis/pub/blob/master/know/music/tool.md) kit for playlist edification.
1. [6344-Ithica](https://github.com/georgalis/pub/blob/master/know/music/6344-Ithica.list), the fifth volume was divinely inspired. It is simply a collection of three CDs purchased in 1994 to memorialize a supernatural sign, rain, directing this musical curation. More on that later.
1. [6350-forte-flute](https://github.com/georgalis/pub/blob/master/know/music/6350-forte-flute.md), volume six is a practice challenge of etudes. Many performances are re-tuned.
1. [63e8-jazzmore](https://github.com/georgalis/pub/blob/master/know/music/63e8-jazzmore.list), volume seven, is an extension of volume two with emphasis on jazz, and a side effect of pruning 63d2-requeues for release.

A breakout of the curation development workflow [tool](tool.md) kit has commenced (for the download of recordings and release management)!
