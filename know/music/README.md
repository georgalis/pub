### Music Curating

Welcome!

In 2020 much effort was taken to organize a playlist of the most important music, timeless music,
for all times.  Following that, subsequent volumes would represent compositions and performances,
supplementing the former.  How many works, from what generas? How many volumes? These are tough
questions, the answer is an amalgamation of careful study, practice, discovery, curation tools
development, time effort balance, and some of the vitality that inspires all things.

In some cases selections have an altered tempo and/or pitch, for all the alteration, there are as
many explanations, but generally, the intent is not to change the style or message, rather the
changes help them fit in the broader timeframe of today, verses when they were new. Certain tonal
intermodulation is accentuated when performed with a baroque temperament, and some compositions
have a piercing element to accentuate an elegant novelty, which may have gone unnoticed when
originally presented. Or, some jazz standards have been performed so slowly that it is difficult to
recognize the melody. Today, Locatelli violin concertos have much to offer common ears melodically,
they are presented 10% slower and a full voice lower, so the subtleties can be heard, verses the high
art of their original form. All of these adjustments, as presented here, are intended to ring
true the authenticity of the music, attenuating charisma of their age and accentuating the elements
that make them timeless.

* The first release is called [5fb3-deja-muse](https://github.com/georgalis/pub/blob/master/know/music/5fb3-deja-muse.md) and came early in 2021.
* The second volume is called 660e-requeues and is a logical extension of the first.
* The third volume is called 5deb-melody-royal, it is a condensed presentation of the fourth volume.
* The fourth volume is called 5d50-kindle-class, and marks the beginning of the effort to identify collections suitable for non-intrusive, edifying, continuous listening at background volumes.
* A fifth volume, was divinely inspired. It is simply a collection of three CDs purchased in 1994 to memorialize a supernatural sign, rain, directing this musical curation. More on that later.

Technical revisions are underway for 5fb3-deja-muse, formal release is approaching for
660e-requeues, release finalization is approaching for 5deb-melody-royal, presentation with new
tools could happen quickly for 5d50-kindle-class, and the fifth volume will be released as its
curation is developed.
